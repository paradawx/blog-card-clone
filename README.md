### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://paradawx.github.io/blog-card-clone/](https://paradawx.github.io/blog-card-clone/)

### Built with

HTML & CSS

### What I learned

I feel like I reinforced my knowledge and could do the majority of the card without much help from google.

Also had some troubles with git because i started the project and then tried to push to a new repo, rather than starting a new repo and cloning as a local copy.

had the most trouble getting the abstract svg dimensions perfect.

```css
.image {
  justify-content: center;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 13rem;
  width: 17.75rem;
  overflow: hidden;
  border-radius: 0.7rem;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}
```
